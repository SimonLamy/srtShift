# srtShift
Python script to shift all subtitles in .srt files.  

Require srt library in order to work : https://github.com/cdown/srt.  

To execute the script in your terminal, you need 3 arguments : original file's full path, delay time in second (positive, negative and float are accepted) and the new name with .srt extension as following :   

``Python User/wherever/you/put/srtShift.py path/to/original.srt -123.5 modified.srt``

The new file will be created in the same directory as the original one. 

I know there are other scripts doing the same job but I did it for fun and learn, may be it could help anyway.
